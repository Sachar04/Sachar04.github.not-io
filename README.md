 # this is comfort
 or in better words: 
this is a small project, to enhance my Web development skills

#### WARNING

This website is absolutely not user firendly, as it uses a lot of libraries and features, that are implemented because of fun
And i did not do any adequate optimization for various devices or browsers, but it **should work on:**
> Chrome, Microsoft Edge
> Some brighter mobile devices
> Average Laptops

#### Remarks
> There is a memory game, have fun and go play it
> 
> There are a lot of things that doesn't make any sence, please just avoid
> I will maybe return to this project, clean a little and optimize everything as much as I can but I do not promise anything.
